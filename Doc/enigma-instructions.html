 <h1>Code Breaking during WWII</h1>
 
 <p> The Enigma machines are a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher
 machines. The first machines were invented at the end of World War I by
 German engineer Arthur Scherbius and were mainly used to protect 
commercial, diplomatic and military communication. Enigma machines 
became more and more complex and were heavily used by the German army 
during World War II to encrypt radio signals.</p>

 <p>You you will be able to use this machine to both encrypt or decrypt 
Enigma messages (Enigma encryption is symmetric, which means that the 
same settings can be used to both encrypt or decrypt a message).</p>
 
 <p>Use our <a onclick="enigmaWindow();">online Enigma emulator</a> to start encoding or decoding secret messages.</p>

 <h1>Inside the Enigma</h1>
 The enigma machine is a fairly complex encryption machine which consists of four main sections:
 <img src="enigma-how-to.png">
 
<h1>The Keyboard</h1>
<p>The keyboard is used to retrieve the user input. The Enigma machine 
is a symmetric encryption machine. Which means that it can be used to 
both encrypt or decrypt a message using the same settings. The keyboard 
is hence used to either enter the plaintext that needs to be encrypted 
or the ciphertext that needs to be decrypted.</p>

<p>They keyboard consists of 26 keys for each letter of the alphabet. 
This means that encrypted messages will be joined up without any spaces 
or punctuation signs.</p>

<p>Notice how the keyboard starts with the letters QWERTZ instead of 
QWERTY. This is due to the fact that in the German language, the letter Z
 is more often used than the letter.</p> 
 
<h1>The plugboard</h1>
<p>Once a key is pressed on the keyboard, it goes through the plugboard 
which provides the first stage of the encryption process. It is based on
 the principles of a substitution cipher, a form of transposition 
encryption.</p>

<p>To setup the keyboards, short wires are used to connect pairs of 
letters that will be permuted. For instance on the picture below the 
letter W will be replaced with a D and the letter D with a W as a (red) 
wire is used to connect these two letters/plugs. Similarly, letter V 
will become letter Z and Z will become V.</p> 

<img src="plugboard.png">
<p>In a code book the plugboard settings would be recorded as follows: DW VZ</p>

<h1>The Rotors</h1>
<p>After the plugboard, the letter goes through the three rotors in 
order (from right to left), each of them changing it differently using a
 combination of transposition cipher and Caesar cipher! On the engima M3
 there are three rotor slots and five rotors to choose from. Each rotor 
is identified using a Roman numeral from I to V. This provides a few 
settings of the Enigma machine: which rotors to use, and in which order 
to position them. In a code book this seeting would be recorded as IV II
 III (Left, Middle and Right rotors).</p>

<p>Each of the five rotors encrypt the letter differently using a 
transposition/permutation cipher and can be connected in the Enigma 
machine with a different <strong>Ring setting</strong>. Another setting 
is the initial position of the rotors: Which letters are you going to 
set each rotor to begin with (e.g. A/B/C../Z sometimes recorded in a 
codebook using numbers (01 for A, 02 for B up to 26 for Z). This creates
 a Caesar Shift (Caesar Cipher). On an Enigma machine, you can change 
the position of the rotors by turning the three wheels.</p>

<p>Different versions of Enigma (e.g. M4) included four rotors which 
made the encryption process and the number of possible settings even 
bigger.
 
</p><p>On our Enigma M3 emulator, you can click on the rotors to access the Enigma rotors settings:</p>
<img src="enigma-Rotors.png">
<img src="enigma-RotorsSettings.png">

<p>What makes the Enigma code particularly difficult to crack is that 
every time a key is pressed, the rotor on the right turns by 1 letter. 
Which means that the encryption settings constantly changes for each 
letter of a message. It also means that a single plaintext letter would 
be encrypted differently depending on its position in the message.</p>

<p>The rotors are also connected to each other so that when the rotor 
positioned on the right reach a specific letter, it triggers the rotor 
in the middle to rotate by one letter. Similarly when the rotor in the 
middle reaches a specific letter it triggers the rotor on the left to 
turn by one letter.</p>

<p>You will find more information on how the rotors operate on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details" target="_blank">following wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<h1>The Reflector</h1>
<p>The reflector is another type of rotor inside the machine. Once the 
letter has gone through the three rotors from right to left, the 
reflector will reflect the electrical current back through the rotors, 
sending the encrypted letter through the rotors from left to right for 
another 3 stages of encryption and then through the plugboard again for a
 final substitution cipher. When going through the reflector, a 
permutation cipher is also applied to the letter.</p>

<p>Different versions of reflectors were used on different versions of 
Enigma machines. Each reflector would apply a different permutation 
cipher. Enigma M3 machines were equipped with either a UKW-B or UKW-C 
reflector. You can apply these two reflectors in the rotor settings 
window of our emulator (see screenshot above).</p>

<h1>The lampboard</h1>
The lampboard is the  final stage of the encryption process and is used 
to show the output (encrypted letter). It consists of 26 light bulbs, 
one for each letter of the alphabet.

<h1>Welchman-Turing Bombe</h1>
	
 <p>One of the key objectives for the Allies during WWII was to find a 
way to break the code to be able to decrypt German communications. A 
team of Polish cryptanalysts was the first to break Enigma codes as 
early as 1932, however the German used more advanced Enigma machines 
making it virtually impossible to break the Enigma code using 
traditional methods. In 1939, with the prospect of war, the Poles 
decided to share their findings with the British. Dilly Knox, one of the
 former British World War I Codebreakers, set up an Enigma Research 
Section at Bletchley Park, England. He worked alongside Tony Kendrick, 
Peter Twinn, Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman. Together they developed a 
complex machine called the Bombe used to workout Enigma settings from 
intercepted German communications. The first wartime Enigma messages 
were broken in January 1940. Being able to decrypt German messages gave 
the Allies valuable information which has had a major impact on the 
outcomes of WWII.</p>
